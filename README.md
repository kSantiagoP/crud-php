# crud-php
A mock up project of a CRUD system in PHP
The database used is made from MySQL. However, the credentials used in your database will certainly be different from the ones I used. To configure them specifically, so that it is possible to execute this project, the config.php file must be configured, changing the username
and password for those on your machine and also the host address, if the test is not running on localhost, for the address of the server running the database.

From there, by running both index.php on a server and uploading the database schema, present in the sqlDump folder in .sql format, the project can be tested.
